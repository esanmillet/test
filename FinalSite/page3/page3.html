            Christianity is one of the three major abrahamic religions. The christian movement started around the time after
            Jesus's death and has grown to be one of the most influential and most practivced religions. Christians adhere to the bible as
            their main source of doctrine but the actual teachings may vary from sect to sect. The main belief is that Jesus Christ
            is the son of God and that through him salvation is found.

            Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama around 2,500 years ago in India. Buddhism is one of the largest
            religions in the world. The teachings of buddhism aim to release suffering from those who follow. Through the
            main teachings of the Buddha we learn that pain and suffering stems from desire and that by releasing one's self
            from that desire or attachment can lead toward a better life without suffering.

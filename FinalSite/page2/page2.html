<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In this section we will do a brief introduction into the philosophical methods of thought. Click each categroy to find out more. Using each method we ask how do we know if something is beautiful through each persepctive.

<h2>Epistomology</h2>
<p>
  The epistomological question is: How do you know what is beauty. In other words what justifies you knowledge of beauty.

<div id="step2" class="step2">
<h2>Rationalist</h2>
<p>
 A rationalist would say that someone is born with the innate idea of beauty. Things are more naturally appealing to children than other things. A child may be naturally born to accept nature to be beautiful because it is a part of that very essence. Another approach would be that without the five senses and previous experience we still have the innate idea of perfection in our head. Nature may be an innate idea that is representative of perfection. Since Nature represents perfection and perfection is beautiful, then nature is beautiful.

<div id="step3" class="step 3">
<h2>Empiricist</h2>
<p>
An empiricist would state that my friend’s knowledge of beauty came from experiences. In other words, my friend had to experience events or things in which were either appealing to him or was appealing to others and so he accepted it as appealing to him. For example, the majority of society has accepted a certain figure of women to be very appealing. A person from there will then have the idea of beautifully molded by society or other factors.

<h2>What would Immanueal Kant say?</h2>
<p>
Immanuel Kant would say that my friend’s knowledge of beauty comes from both innate ideas and experiences. For instance, he may state that we are born with the innate idea of perfection and so that anything close to it will be beautiful to us. He will also say that my friend may also be influenced by outside sources. For instance, my friend could have grown up outdoors a lot and has learned to appreciate certain types of flowers over the others. Maybe he thinks that the flower is beautiful because it is his parent’s favorite color of the flower. Both factors play a role in influencing his knowledge of beauty.

<h2>Descartes</h2>
<p>
Descartes uses an ontological method of reasoning. Because sense data is misleading and can be doubted he discards any information achieved from that. If none of the senses can be trusted then he must truly think rationally with a thought that doesn’t pertain to such senses or prior experiences with it. He describes this to be the thought of perfection. Since we as humans have the thought of perfection in our head somewhere we can determine what is imperfect for ourselves. Because we have this innate thought of perfect it must mean that God exists as the concept of perfection.  The evil genius is a concept that an evil demon has placed an illusion on the external world and does everything in its power to deceive Descartes. Descartes uses this to cast aside any knowledge claimed by his senses because they can be doubted. If the evil genius exists then it would defy logic and mathematics. But math is most real and what is real is perfect so the only thought logically without using senses and prior experiences is that of perfection. So He uses this to claim that god exists but as a concept of perfection.

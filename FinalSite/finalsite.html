            Welcome to my site! Here at Simple Thought we are all about going
            above and beyond in serving you with the tools to become more culturally
            aware and understanding in different philosophies of thought and religion.
            It is important to note that we are a site in the early developmental stages
            but once everything is settled we plan to update you every week through blogs
            and articles about the latest information and resources on the subject at hand!
            Religion historically has played a key role in explaining the origins of the universe
            as well as why certain events occur. Over time some religions have died out while others emerged.
            Today in modern times, people try to understand the universe in different ways.
            This may or may not include a belief in God. In this site we tackle the big questions
            in life and draw theories and conclusions based on science and different views of thought
            that exists.

            In our philosophy section you can find out how contemporary as well as ancient
            philosophers used rational and logic to draw conclusions about life. From here,
            you will learn how to thin and interact with the physical realm in a different manner.
            As Socrates, one of the greatest philosophers of his time put it, the wise know not anything
            concretely but contemplate life's biggest questions.

            In our religion section you will greatly increase your knowledge and
            cross cultural awareness about different beliefs and practices. Here at
            simple thought, we believe that increasing you cultural intelligence will
            help make the world a better and more understanding place. You will learn how
            and why people believe certain things about the world and historically that has been developed over time.

            We also want to tackle the scientific aspects of different beliefs more than ever and have
            our audience skeptically make decisions for themselves as to whether it is valid evidence or
            not. The process is to just encourage thoughtfulness as well as different aspects of thought to
            have fruitful conversation and beneficial debate. We post videos under our inspiration
            as well as other content and resources that may help you along your quest for knowledge. We
            also took into account website design and content so we left links with our inspiration. Thank you! Now it is time
            to learn!
